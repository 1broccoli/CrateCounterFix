# Crate Counter Fix Moved!

🎯 **The crate counter fix has been moved to its own folder:**

📁 **[CrateCounterFix/](CrateCounterFix/)**

## Quick Start
```bash
cd CrateCounterFix
python crate_counter_controller.py
```

Or use the batch file:
```cmd
cd CrateCounterFix
START_CRATE_FIX.bat
```

## What's Fixed
- **300/100 = 3 cars, not 1 car**
- Proper reward calculation based on complete cycles
- GameGuardian pattern integration
- Android IL2CPP support
